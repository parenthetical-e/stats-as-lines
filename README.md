# Statistical tests as linear models - unrankling ranks
Jonas LindelÃ¸v wrote a [nice blog post](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/#3_pearson_and_spearman_correlation) explaining how common statistical tests amount to special cases of linear regression. This is real neat unfication of tests that at first pass look unrelated. His work included examples of nonparametric tests, based on ranks. But he seems to dismiss nonparametric tests as not that different from parametric ones. That seemed off. But I realized that my intuition for what ranks do to datawas too limited to say for sure. So I made some examples here to try and understand ranks better.

# Usage
Open up the `Rmd` notebook and play! (If you're not familair with [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), read the next section.)

# Dependencies
All experiments are done in [Rmarkdown](https://rstudio.com) notebooks, in the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) using tools from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).

You'll need a recent copy of [R studio](https://rstudio.com), and a R version >3.5.1 (2018-07-02).
