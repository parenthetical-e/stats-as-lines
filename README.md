Statistical tests as linear models - unrankling ranks

Jonas Lindel√∏v wrote a [nice blog post](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/#3_pearson_and_spearman_correlation) explaining how common statistical tests amount to special cases of linear regression. This is real neat unfication of tests that at first pass look unrelated. His work included examples of nonparametric tests, based on ranks. But he seems to dismiss nonparametric tests as not that different from parametric ones. That seemed off. But I realized that my intuition for what ranks do to datawas too limited to say for sure. So I made some examples here to try and understand ranks better.
